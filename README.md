## Description

As a current student, I wanted to create a Note Taker that would help a user to create a list of notes.  The Note Taker would store necessary information and allow the user to save it to the list.

The user would be able to refresh the page and all the saved notes would remain.  The user would also be able to open note that was already saved.  Allowing the user to quickly and easily a note list.

## Notes:

I received help on the helper.js file and takeNotes.js file from a tutor, [Scott Everett](https://calendly.com/fsf-tutor-team/scott-everett?month=2023-06).

I also received help on creating the unique id's from BCS Learning Assistants (Spider & Shaun).
