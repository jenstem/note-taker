## Description

As a current student, I wanted to create a Note Taker that would help a user to create a list of notes.  The Note Taker would store necessary information and allow the user to save it to the list.

The user wouldn't need to style or add any code to create the SVG file, simply the information when prompted.  The logo would then be generated using the information that the user provided.  Allowing the user to quickly and easily generate their own logo.
